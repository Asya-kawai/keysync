 * Load new configs on each run
 * Global config file instead of command line flags
 * Status checks that check something
 * Logging & Sentries on failure/success
 * Metrics
 * Backoff / throttling
 * Randomized interval
 * Optimization: Don't reload secret contents if unchanged (reduce server load)
 * Optimization: Share secret content with hardlink if possible (reduce tmpfs RAM usage)
 * Tmpfs enforcement
 * Tamper detection of files
 * self-sandboxing with namespaces & cap_chown
    * `sudo unshare --mount become keysync ./keysync?`
 * Unit tests - normal go unit tests
 * Functional tests - against a test server
 * Integration tests - against a real keywhiz server
 * Factor out common client library
 * Kill dead code imported
 * Refactor & cleanup
 * Shutdown handling of some sort (catch signal, log, exit)
